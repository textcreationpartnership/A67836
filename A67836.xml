            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IT hath been often and long char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on ſome of your Brethren, who have appear'd in a great Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, that they were <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and thoſe not of the beſt Edition, <hi>Criſpians;</hi> but ſome of your Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Brethren, as well as you, could not believe it, till.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101963:3"/>
               <p n="1">1. They ſaw ſome open Vouchers for Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> his Notions, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd ſhame and ſorrow to ſome of you, and Ingenious Confeſſions that they had betrayed your Cauſe: One of which is indeed an Ingenious Man, and diſcovers in his Writings good reading. He is a good Philologiſt, Philoſopher. Divine, and Satyriſt, and it is believed he hath made the beſt of a bad Cauſe, tho not without many and conſiderable flaws. It was his unhappineſs, more then his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts, to charge him with a <hi>Bomba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Style.</hi> This I knew not, being a ſtranger in <hi>London</hi> till very lately.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Till they ſaw others open Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Fautors of an <hi>Impudent, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, Corrupt, Impertinent.</hi> The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Account will prove this, to be his true Character.</p>
               <p>I think it Sirs, proper to begin with a ſhort, very ſhort, Scheme of Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> his Doctrine, which I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Six Months ſince occaſion to look into, being charged by his Son (in a friendly Letter I confeſs) with wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father in my <hi>Vindiciae Anti-Baxterianae,</hi> and alſo being often told by others that I was miſtaken, not only
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101963:3"/>in the Dr's ſence, but phraſes too. This gave me the Curioſity of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquiry, with a reſolution to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my miſtakes, if any ſuch. But I found much worſe then I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or then I knew others had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of. I ſent for his Son (whom I yet value) deſiring him to come to my Lodgings, or to appoint me a time when I might wait on him: He refuſed, paſſing, as I hear, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement upon me, I was a ready Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſeem'd to me, to argue guilt. The Scheme is this. <q rend="margQuotes">That God Loveth the elect with a Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cential Love, in the State of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, when in the heigth of all their Wickedneſs, Whoredoms, Murthers, Thefts, and that he hath no more to lay to their charge then to the charge of any Saint in Heaven.—That they are not the Sinners, but Chriſt was the Sinner.—That when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me;</hi> He was ſeparate from God, and odious to him as a Toad to a Man, and ſo continued till he Roſe from the Dead, and then was there a kind of renewing the Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.—That
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101963:4"/>not only the guilt of our Sins, and Obligation to puniſhment, lay on Chriſt, but the Loathſomneſs, Abominableneſs, and Pollution of Sin it ſelf, till he breath'd it out And that as the ſtain of in it ſelf was on him, ſo he bore all the ſadneſs due for Sin, and that whoever hath any ſadneſs for Sin is out of Chriſt, the way: And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſpeak of himſelf, but only perſonated a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Man, when he ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.28. <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Death?</hi>—That Faith is an <hi>Et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> of the Soul, Anſwering the Call, I come—without any change in Man. That <hi>Pauls</hi> Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was not a Juſtification before God, but in the Heart and Conſcience of Man: That Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation cannot be known or eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſanctification. altho <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>Bleſſed is the Man to whom the Lord imputeth Righteouſneſs without works.</hi>

               <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <p n="1">1. Not by Univerſal obedience (and here he moſt unphiloſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally

               <p>But no end is there of Naming the black, horrid, and blaſphemous Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Expreſſions in that Book: Which I have not by me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be expected I ſhould Cite Chapter and Page, yet I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any of his Advocates to charge me with miſ-repreſenting him. I will not boaſt how exactly, I have kept as to ſence ſo words: Tho when I ſaw the Book laſt, I little thought to have this occaſion to appear againſt it, for which, now this among other things ſhall be my Apology, It was reported I was gotten to the height of <hi>Criſpia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> by I ſuppoſe thoſe who would have it to be ſo, who alſo ſay, every Lecturer at <hi>Pinners-Hall</hi> are theirs.

               <p>But ſome of the Drs. <hi>Creatures,</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> or <hi>Well-wiſhers,</hi> or however we phraſe it, thus plead for him.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101963:5"/>
               <p>That tho they will not juſtify the Dr. his hard phraſes, yet will his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Notions. That the Famous <hi>Witchius</hi> (the <hi>Dutch</hi> Divine in a <hi>Latin</hi> Tract) that, that truly great Man, Mr. <hi>How,</hi> and that honeſt Dr. <hi>Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and others, charge not the Dr. ſo high as many others do.</p>
               <p>To all which I Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Are hard dangerous Expreſſions nothing, if your Plea were not a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake? Which by no means muſt be granted you.</p>
               <p>What if at a full Table, All the Diſhes there, were accounted good, and wholeſom; only of one Diſh ſome ſaid, The Meat was very unſafe, dangerous, unwholeſom, others ſaid no: All was good, and ſafe. Only they granted, with all the Company, the ſawce was very bad, and ſuch, as ſome ſaid, the Meat was, would not a wiſe Man, eſpecially if weak and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leave that one ſuſpected Diſh, and Eat of the unexceptionable good ones? What need we meddle (ſay I) with this, at leaſt ſuſpitious book, (but others know to be worſe then <hi>Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>) when we have ſuch excellent Tracts, done by Men of great Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101963:5"/>and Men very Orthodox, all whoſe Doctrine is Acknowledged to be true, and their Expreſſions ſafe. Own, ſay I, ſuch Tracts and let <hi>This</hi> go ſhift for it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Witchius</hi> chargeth him high, if not ſo high as others. And ſome wiſe Men at home, think that Learned Forreigner underſtood not our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies here when all is done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for Mr. <hi>How,</hi> and others with him, I can truly ſay, that I ever thought it (as did many Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, as well as Presbyterian Divines) to be at leaſt an unjuſtifyable practice, to hang out ſuch a Sign to Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> his Book. Which no doubt decoyed not a few, as if they approv'd the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therein contain'd. And tho that great Man in his ſubtil defence of himſelf, was pleas'd to ask Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whether if Dr. <hi>C. were now alive?</hi> He would have him ſilenced for his Errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know not what was Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> mind in this thing, ſeeing he was not pleas'd to tell us, but this I doubt not to ſay; The Dr. deſerv'd it, and that I could not cenſure him who had Power to do it, thus to do.</p>

               <p n="4">4. That Dr. <hi>Beverly</hi> might mean honeſtly, tho miſtaken in this, as in other things. How weak! Good Man, are his Attempts, to Reconcile Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> together, every one that hath half an Eye may ſee. Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> ſaith, he, was a <hi>Son of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee, Dr.</hi> Criſp <hi>of Conſolation, and God gives various gifts for the benefit of the Church,</hi> &amp;c.

One that ſays, Faith is put by a <hi>Synecdoche for all other Graces, and is all one with Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel obedience;</hi> and therefore Man is juſtified before <hi>God by Faith, and works.</hi> And he that ſays, <hi>Man is juſtified before God, not by works nor Faith neither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Doctrine be as the Itch, I have often ſaid, Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> his Doctrine is as the Plague. I confeſs Dr. <hi>Beverlys</hi> Eſſays, to reconcile the Reverend Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> together, looks with a little better hue and dreſs. Yet his diſtinctions of our Sins on Chriſt, by way <hi>of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and adheſion,</hi> Nor his diſcovery of that place of Scripture, where Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>Come the ſecond time
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101963:6"/>without Sin unto ſalvation;</hi> As if he came with Sin in his firſt coming, in my apprehenſion, are not ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, eſpecially when ſo many good ſound ſences may be put on theſe laſt words. By the way, I doubt not but this (otherwiſe famous and worthy Divine) will be found to be a falſe Prophet, whether he be a falſe Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor or no. I wiſh him prepar'd for ſuch a ſtorm as Monſieur <hi>Jerue,</hi> after his magnifying the Apocalyptical <hi>Mead,</hi> and the expiration of his two Years, met with.

               </p>
               <p>Others plead, That in ſome places, the Dr. doth own that Juſtification is evidenced by Sanctification.</p>
               <p>I know he doth in one Sermon, and much more ſtiffly deny it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet theſe contradictory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes

               <p n="1">1. If the Dr. were inconſiſtent with himſelf, who can help it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Were not thoſe Sermons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he owns this Office of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Preacht long before the Dr. came to the higheſt flight of his Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſick brain'd Notions?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Were they not put in here to alay the harſhneſs of other corrupt diſcourſes, and as a Decoy?</p>
               <p>Others plead for the Doctor.</p>
               <p>How can we tell whether ſuch words were the Doctors or no? Thoſe Printed Papers were only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Notes taken from him. I Anſwer, it would be good News to us, to hear it well prov'd, that none of the Book was his, and the whole a meer ſham. In ſhort, we therefore Condemn the Book. We object here; and ſecure you the Man as well as you can. But this will be a ſhrode Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, if not againſt others, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Son (ſaid to be Honeſt and Conſcientious, not Poyſoned with his Fathers Doctrine when ſearcht) who Publiſht the Book.

               <p n="4">4.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101963:8"/>muſt be digg'd low, if the ſuperſtructure be rais'd high: Faith without Repentance will as ſurely be found to be Preſumption, as ever was a Repentance without Faith prov'd to be Deſperation. God wounds and then heals. Wine (an abſterſive clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thing) as well as Oyl (a comfortable thing) were poured in the <hi>Samaritans</hi> wounds. The Law knows no Repentance: As it doth not for Murther or Theft, in our Courts of Judicature. Theſe Men take all fears to be unbelief, tho never ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Did <hi>Paul</hi> indeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.28. <hi>Perſonate a Scrupulous Man,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> ſays? In other words, did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mock at them, who were in ſuch a frame? When I think, <hi>Paul</hi> never appear'd more Lovely in the Eyes of a Holy God, and all experimental mortified ſelf knowing Chriſtians, then when in that Glorious (becauſe humble) array.</p>
               <p>This Paſſage drops not from the Dr. unadviſedly, but conſiderately: Not by the by, but on his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, <hi>That all ſadneſs due for Sin, was on Chriſt, and he that had any ſadneſs for Sin was out of Chriſt the way.</hi> This
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101963:8"/>wicked Paſſage kindled my Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Put this in practice, and ſuch can never know God, or their own Hearts, and conſequently this their Hereſie muſt be damnable. I more fully Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> at that time knew Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> as well as we now, may he queried, or whether he indeed gave this good Character of him, is more then all of us can prove. But for the other part of his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>his want of Learning,</hi> and others (I know) his <hi>want of Logick,</hi> I never doubted it; Therefore it is the more to be wondered, that ſuch a Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould be ſuch a Bluſterer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That I have heard from Good hands (and his Son yet alive knows the truth of it,) That Fifty Miniſters who knew Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> and his Doctrine, here, ſet themſelves againſt him. Theſe were no <hi>Arminians</hi> ſure, but <hi>Calviniſts, Baxterianiſm</hi> if conceiv'd, was not then come to the Birth. Did not theſe Fifty Orthodox Men, break the Heart of this Doctor? However, I doubt not; This Plea or Covering is too thin, for Dr. <hi>Criſp was no Fool.</hi> For thoſe who acknowledge his Piety, It is well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101963:9"/>by ſome, the Power of Grace: That a Man ſhould have ſo many Poyſonous Principles continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and yet not corrupt his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. Whether he declin'd long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed, I meddle not with, I wonder if it were not ſo.</p>
               <p>Others plead. But did not <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf, and other Divines uſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as bad? No. He call'd Chriſt indeed, <hi>Maximus Peccatorum,</hi> which I will not cenſure, nor juſtify, and be ſure I never will (as I never did) uſe ſuch a phraſe, tho <hi>imputatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne tantum,</hi> he clapt to it. The worſt words I ever find <hi>Luther</hi> to uſe, and wonder the Papiſt, that mention other things, do not this, <hi>Coll. Menſal. (The beſt Book bearing his Name I ever ſaw, yet this great Flaw) Were I as our Lord, God, and ſhould the World deſpiſe my Son, as they do his, I would ſet it on Fire.</hi> O vile ſuppoſition, and deſperate Talk! For what <hi>Kelliſon,</hi> and other Jeſuits charge on him, that <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Si non vult <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor, veniat Ancilla,</hi> it may be juſtified. If a Confeſſour charge a Wife not to Lye with her Husband, or to yeild him due Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, becauſe a Proteſtant or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101963:9"/>(abominable) if the Wife will not Cohabit, if <hi>She will depart, let her depart, ſaith</hi> Paul, <hi>I leave no Man in Bondage:</hi> Let the Maid be made the Wife and Miſtriſs too. The Story of <hi>Galeacius Caracciolus,</hi> is too well known, and the Judgment of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines he conſulted to be mention'd here.</p>
               <p>Others plead. Oh, Dr. <hi>Criſp got me out of my Legal Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Were you ever in that Spirit you call thus? If ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Were you not got out too ſoon? Was not the wound skin'd over, that ſhould have been more ſearcht and heal'd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hath he gotten ſome Men that thus talk out of their <hi>Lying</hi> Spirit, or <hi>Dead</hi> Spirit? <hi>What a horrid ſhame is it, for Men to make a Noiſe; I cannot ſit under ſuch a Mans Preaching, he is no Goſpel Miniſter:</hi> And yet be found in Notorious untruths, telling Lyes, ſo Contradictory for a <hi>Criſpian,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Accuſers. I could be very particular, were it meet to talk with ſuch pieces of Impudence, who, like Men in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> think the Spectatours to be what they themſelves indeed are.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101963:10"/>
               <p n="4">4. Some plead. But Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> doth confeſs, That if a Man lead a vitious Life after his <hi>Eccho,</hi> &amp;c. He is not a believer, I know he doth thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but yet I was greatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How <hi>faintly</hi> he comes to ſuch Aſſertions, as a Man that muſt ſay ſo, rather then would.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He knew, had he not ſo done, he had paſt for an <hi>Old Gnoſtick,</hi> or an <hi>Arch Ranter,</hi> and no more need to be ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet, I pray, Let us reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If Faith be ſuch <hi>An Eccho of the Soul, Anſwering the Call, I come without any change in Man, and this muſt not be tryed by the Word, for it is a diſparagement to the Spirit to be ſo try'd</hi> (the very Dregs of Quaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm I am ſure, if a Man know he hath given that Eccho; I profeſs, I cannot ſee but he may be a Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee after, and be loved by God with a Complacential Delight as before the Eccho given, and yet all well.</p>
               <p>Now having conſider'd the beſt or chief Pleas I could ever hear for the Doctor, I will ask his Advocates a few Queſtions. What think you of thoſe that ſhall ſay:</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101963:10"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is a comfortable thing to hear that unconverted Men may come to God as a Reconciled God!</hi> I care not to name particular Perſons, for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have more than once given in ſome Books; but I am ready to prove, if occaſion be. Others,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they were never guilty of Sin, nor condemn'd by the Law: and being ask'd, <hi>Whether they never confeſs Sin?</hi> anſwer, No, <hi>When they are in a good Frame.</hi> Others, when diſwaded from worldly buſineſs on a Lord's Day, ſay, <hi>Chriſt bath kept the Sabbath for them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Can theſe find their way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Not the old one; and if their own new one will do, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, let them not be too confident till they ſee the end of it. Theſe, and ſuch as theſe are the Men I would ferret out of their Holes; my Work lies not with Men a little lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, for I queſtion not the Piety of many call'd <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who know not the depths of Satan, nor the natural Conſequence of their Opinions, tho very corrupt.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:101963:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>How common is it in the Country for ſome Preachers to tell the People, Sirs, God loves you as much with a Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cential Love, when in your Whoredoms, and other Sins, as the Saints, when pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or performing any Religious Duty? Is it indeed the Pride of Min's Heart to deny God to be the Author of Sin?</hi> muſt your own learned pious Brethren be ready to wring their Hands to hear ſuch Stories proved upon Men of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But becauſe it is often pleaded, that God loved the Elect before Converſion with a Complacential Love; for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible God ſhould hate at one time, and love at another the ſame Perſon; if he do, he is a changeable God.</hi> And here we are often told what Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> ſaid about this, <hi>That Juſtification was an Imminent Act in God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſhall omit what others have ſaid about this; particularly, Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams in his Goſpel Truth ſtated and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,</hi> a Book magnified by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Club, by my worthy Friend, Mr. <hi>Giles Fermin,</hi> now dead, a ſound <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> and others.

Is not the Contexture curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Notions deep, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſolid, and the whole a work of Art? I vindicate his cenſure of Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> his Extravagancies. Are baſe little Stories a Reply? They who have thrown dirt in his Face have daubed their own Hands. What a ſhameful thing is it, for <hi>London</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who ſhould be a good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to us in the Country, to be worſe than we? That they cannot contend about a Cauſe, but they muſt ſeek for little falſe Tales to revile the Perſons, (an Error on all Hands) I declare. I think once is enough to anſwer the Doctor his Harrangues, and it cannot be done better than by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and there I refer the <hi>Reader,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not willing, <hi>Actum agere.</hi>

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:101963:12"/>
               <p>But to this great Objection.</p>
               <p>I remember when I firſt read Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> that great Man, and found him tainted, <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> and that he ſmartly replied to many Objections that lay before him, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected an Anſwer to one, which I ſaw he thought not of; if he had thought of it, had he been of that Opinion?</p>
               <p>I demand therefore;</p>
               <p>Did not God once love the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels, whom now he hates, when they once loved him, with a Complacential Love, and praiſed him with Joy and Delight before his Throne? Who can ſay, <hi>Theſe were not ſome of the Angels that ſang and ſhouted for Joy, when God laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Earth.</hi> How ſtrange would it be to deny their Complacential Love to God, to follow Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential Love to them? Did God hate them, when they Lov'd him? Speak out if you think ſo. Well: Doth not God hate them now, ſince their Apoſtacy, and will he not do ſo for ever! Now, if God could Love Angels and then hate them, and not be changed (becauſe they be ſo) then can he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101963:12"/>hate unconverted Men, and afterward Love them, and not be a changeable God, but they are changed Men. Love in <hi>affectu or effectu,</hi> I meddle not with in God, onely</p>
               <p>Love I grant, and you cannot deny is not predicated Univocally of God and us, as if it were a thing of the ſame Nature. No, it is not ſo much: Nor yet,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it ſpoken of God and us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocally. It is not ſo little: As if only one Name, for two diſtinct things quite different. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Analogically, ſome reſemblance there is, between our Complacential Love and Gods. God ſpeaks to us after our manner, as Nurſes to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>This being the reſult of free thoughts in then Reading, and never meeting with it from any Man, and finding many pleas'd with it, I have deſir'd a reply from ſome <hi>Criſpians.</hi> Say they,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may be thoſe Apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſtood not long, not ſo long as Man. <hi>Apage nugas!</hi> A Thouſand Years and an hour is all one in this Caſe.</p>

His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Morals are talkt of every where. God teſtifies from Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this untoward Generation. I ſaw ſeveral Letters lately from Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Congregational Divines, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſome here in <hi>London,</hi> who greatly bewail theſe Abominations. They tell us of ſome that openly denied Chriſt preach'd <hi>Repentance,</hi> becauſe he preach'd <hi>glad Tydings;</hi> and when it was openly teſtified againſt, and ſaid: But Chriſt did Preach Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The Anſwer was, But did he not go beyond, or beſide his Commiſſion?</p>
               <p>For my part, I am in continual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a New Sect of Ranters, as bad as the old ones, which may provoke our Governours to take away our Liberty from us, ſeeing it is ſo abuſed. I have heard ſome have thus threatned, if they find Criſpia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm a thriving weed.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:101963:15"/>
               <p>In <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> in a Town I knew, were there in <hi>Olivers</hi> Days, a ſort of Ranters headed by a Preacher, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt a Linen-Draper I know not) they would ſay; <hi>We could not take off our Cups when with you, and would ſwear as a part of their Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> One of them told a ſerious Friend of mine, <hi>What talk you of Sin? I would make no ſcruple to kill you, but I will not do it, becauſe I love you.</hi> One of them at laſt <hi>was a God,</hi> and the other <hi>was a Devil.</hi> Then <hi>God</hi> would ſpeak to the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the <hi>Devil to God,</hi> If thou <hi>art a God,</hi> &amp;c. One of this Company was ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Divine diſpleaſure, that he went up and down Winter and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Thirty Years barefooted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, I have often heard ſome of his Blaſphemies from him, (<hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of <hi>Marsfield</hi>).</p>
               <p>What, I pray, did <hi>Cob</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers do at <hi>Ely?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To hear a Fool ſay, <hi>The Gifts and Callings of God are without Repentance,</hi> and therefore <hi>Repentance is no duty now,</hi> might make any ſick to hear it. When it is ſo clear, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Gods not Repenting of the bleſſings he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows on us, not of our not Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>It hath been no ſmall Reflection, I confeſs, on the Oxthodox Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Divines, that they never had the Courage to appear againſt the <hi>Criſpians,</hi> tho they have againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Men. A few ſheets in Print, would have prov'd your Zeal lay, not only againſt theſe, but them: Thoſe unclean Birds would ſhelter themſelves under your Wings, as if theirs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> indeed, in a late Ingenious Diſcourſe (by which he hath much oblig'd the World) ſays plainly in his Preface, <hi>That I may appear impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, I do declare, That I believe, that the</hi> Antinomian Dotages, <hi>have much occaſion'd the growth of the</hi> Socinianiſm <hi>and</hi> Deiſm <hi>of the Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had lately a Letter from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Divine in <hi>Devon,</hi> who thus writ me. <hi>There is not one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Divine in this County, that owns</hi> Criſp <hi>his Notions, nor any, but ſome</hi> Anabaptiſt: <hi>It is ſo apparently impious and ungrounded, that I am aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, how Men of Principles can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101963:16"/>to it. But what hath it to do with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, or Independents with it? If it did, any thing flow from Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Principles, I ſhould think my ſelf unſafe in thoſe approaches, my Judgment hath made to them, and muſt flee with horrour from them, tho not to the other extream.</hi> Some of that perſwaſion here cry, <hi>We are all undone, we ſhall be the moſt Contemptible Perſons on Earth, if theſe ignorant Preachers thus go on.</hi> For my part, I ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that I think <hi>Arminianiſin</hi> it ſelf, to be a <hi>lovely, innocent</hi> thing, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of <hi>Criſpianiſm,</hi> tho I own <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s Doctrine, Old Proteſtaniſm (and that in the Supralapſarian way, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, I never much contend.) Now what muſt I expect from ſome Men? <hi>Oh, this is he, that began well, and hath ſince made his Recantation: We know the Circumſtances of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom.</hi> Did I begin well? Then I continue ſo, for in my <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> I do diſown Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> his <hi>abominable Phraſes and Doctrine,</hi> foreſeeing I ſhould be reported by ſome to be of that Number. If you can tell <hi>all about the Recantation,</hi> You can tell more then I. It is a falſe Charge, as ſome great
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101963:17"/>Men know, who lately have had the contrary under my own hand: Who indeed I know wiſh it, yet I will be free.</p>
               <p>When I ſaw ſome Congregational Divines, as well as others ſay, <hi>My Vindiciae was too ſharp;</hi> I have ſaid to them and others, <hi>That I could wiſh two or three Paſſages out of the Book, as</hi> James 3.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho I yet add, other Pious and Learned Divines ſaid, It was not too ſharp; particularly, The Famous Mr. <hi>Giles Fermin</hi> (ſince dead) in a Letter to me, whoſe Name and Habitation he diligently enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being pleas'd with the whole of the Book. After ſome undeſerved Expreſſions of reſpect, he tells me, That having to deal with ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Applauder of himſelf, and Vilifier of others, <hi>No moderate Man,</hi> (they were his words) can ſay, I was too ſharp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To whom I replyed the ſame Day, <hi>That ſome moderate Men did think it was too ſharp, and I was of their Opinion, not of his</hi>—Thoſe were, I well remember, my very words. I did intend to have Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted alſo on the Book of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Redemption, publiſhed by that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101963:17"/>good Man, (for ſo I doubt not he is) Mr. <hi>Read.</hi> I did intend it ſhould have been the work of time, as well as pains, for I profeſs, ſlight it who will, and ſay it is an <hi>unlearned Tract;</hi> It made me ſweat to Reply to ſome difficulties. Mr. <hi>Fermins</hi> words to me in a Letter, I ſhall not forget: Who wiſht me a <hi>good deliverance,</hi> for ſaid he, <hi>I know not what to ſay, being not able to Anſwer the Arguments on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſide.</hi> When I further examin'd Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> upon the foremention'd Charge, and ſaw the <hi>Gangreen</hi> ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>City,</hi> I had done with that matter, and, undeſired by any Man, I threw my Papers againſt Univerſal Redemption in the Fire: And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to trouble my ſelf no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any thing Mr. <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Read</hi> ſhould publiſh whilſt <hi>Criſpianiſm</hi> was on the thriving hand. Suppoſe, a Man ſhould ſtrike out one of my Eyes, another ſhould cut off both of my Legs, after which would I moſt earneſtly ſend a Hue and Cry? Had I known the City ſo well as I do now, and its preſent Contagion, I had ſaid leſs of another ſort of Men, and more of you. And now Call this a Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101963:18"/>if you pleaſe, for it is the greateſt I ever made. What have you to do with our Controverſies? You know the plain, common, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar apt Compariſon; If two Dogs be a fighting, if a Bare break in, they both give over, and ſet upon him? When we were fighting, comes the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Bare, which makes us give over, and ſet upon him. Nay, to be plain, I would not be aſhamed to Call on the <hi>Arminians</hi> themſelves, to help in this work, againſt this dangerous, exceeding dangerous Enemy.</p>
               <p>I dread neither you nor them, as they well know. I have no prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but refuſe it. A negative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, I ſhall be thankful to you or them, or any other for.</p>
               <p>For my part, I declare, I hear good, ſound, well ſtudied Sermons, both at <hi>Pinners,</hi> and <hi>Saltars-Hall</hi> Lectures. But may it not diſpleaſe if I ſhould ſay, If it pleas'd them at <hi>Pinners-Hall,</hi> to Preach more of Chriſt as a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, as well as juſtifier, and them of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars-Hall</hi> to Preach more of Chriſt as a Juſtifier, as well as Sanctifier, They ſhould have my Conſent, and I doubt not, of many that hear them. Would
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101963:18"/>not this be a good mixture, and make ſuch Savoury Meat as the Soul of a ſerious Chriſtian Loveth?</p>
               <p>They are all Men of Worth, and Learning and God Loveth them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they love one another.</p>
               <p>It is the good honeſt Complaint of ſome Congregational Men, who, when they bring their Children, and Servants with them to their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; hear ſo much of <hi>Comforting of Saints.</hi> What is this, ſay they, to them? Who ſhould hear awakening Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Converſion, and Subjects ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them. Beſides, ſay I, we live in an Age, wherein Religion runs at ſo low an Ebb, That where one Good Man need be told of Comfort, a Hundred had need to be told of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, Watchfulneſs and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and of greater uſefulneſs. Where do we ſee ſo many fainting ſad Chriſtians, that ſo many Cordials muſt be brought, when there is need of Griping, working things? They muſt not be told much of Duty, Activity for God, this is Legal Preaching forſooth. All Lenatives, no Purgatives: What ſhall be ſaid to great Profeſſours (Pillars too) that make
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101963:19"/>nothing of an <hi>officious Lye to help out a bargain,</hi> of ſitting <hi>long at the wine,</hi> of <hi>defrauding others;</hi> Sins inconſiſtent with grace if continued in? Let them think what they pleaſe, do theſe want Comfort? It is true, when the Dogs are beat, the Children cry; yet this is ſometimes neceſſary notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Sinners muſt be told their own, as well as Believers theirs.</p>
               <p>One great Cauſe of the aforenamed Corruptions, I take to be the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of unqualified Tradeſmen, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, ſuch as ſet up for the only Goſpel Preachers.</p>
               <p>Many Tradeſmen may be, and are ſuch as may deſerve the Name of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wiſe Chriſtians, but yet make woful ignorant Teachers. <hi>Who is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, for theſe things?</hi>

Yet ſome deny it, and I am ſure, they care not to own it. I ſhall not ſay much of the Rude Treatment (much talkt of) to me and others, when we went to hear him <hi>VVhit-Monday,</hi> before and after his Text, leſt it ſhould be thought to be the Great Cauſe of my appearing againſt him. Which I declare to be no Cauſe at all, but yet might be a ſufficient excuſe to Cut him up, and ſend him to the Tribes in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with, ſee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and ſpeak your Minds.

               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, which is ſo <hi>Rich,</hi> and <hi>Copious,</hi> yet here hath that <hi>Penury,</hi> that it will hardly afford words, to ſet forth the Vanity of this late Preaching Linen-Draper, whom I was deſir'd to hear, which I did with reluctancy.

I will only put them in mind, That when <hi>Hannibal</hi> paſt over the <hi>Alps,</hi> and had a hard Paſſage, Fire, Vinegar, Salt, are us'd to make his way, which in other places he did not. That I am almoſt Fifty Year Old, and never appear'd in any Controverſy till a Year ſince coming to <hi>London;</hi> A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> of which it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid, <hi>He that hath loſt his Religion may there find it.</hi> I take this to be one
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101963:21"/>Cauſe, why our Tradeſmens Mouths water after a Pulpit. They ſee in ſome Glubs here in the City, they may ſpeak their Opinions before Miniſters (and controul them to boot, as if their Inferiours) <hi>Latin,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> words thrown out, and half of them Crackt. And Glorious Nonſence, and ſplendid impertinences, in Divinity and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, as if they were infallible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatours. Nay, one ſhall aſſert <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> another <hi>deny Original Sin.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> Another aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the <hi>Salvation of Damned Souls and Devils;</hi> which hath tyr'd out the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the moſt Patient Miniſters, and made private Men doubt all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Not only particular Miniſters, but the <hi>function it ſelf</hi> ſhall be jib'd at, and that before their Faces, by Anti-miniſterial Men, who admire themſelves, when others deſpiſe them.

               <p>When I heard the moſt judicious Congregational Divines, cry out of imprudence of two of their Brethren, as Favourers of <hi>this Man</hi> and his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> Some juſtifying him, another cenſuring, I was prevail'd to go to the Meeting, and as I deſired my

We ſate with all imaginable Reverence, when the Gentleman aſcends the Pulpit, and ſate down with ſtretch Arms, as if it had been my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his Grace, we heard the Prayer, and this Zealous <hi>Criſpian Would-be,</hi> brings the Controverſy even there. <hi>That when God gave Man a perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her own, he threw it away, and ſuch a Croſs Creature was he, that when God had provided a perfect Righteouſneſs in another, he would have Righteouſneſs of his own.</hi> When Praying for Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> (then Sick, as if his <hi>Patron</hi>) he gave God thanks for <hi>Raiſing him up, and well it was ſo, when he threatned to take away the Champion of the Cauſe.</hi> After moſt impudent and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words, The Text was Named, <hi>John</hi> 11.21. Which compare with 20.23, 24, 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Were they not intended Murtherers? <hi>Sirs, we would ſee Jeſus.</hi> We.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101963:22"/>now a Doctrine. Doct. <hi>That it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Written in the Heart of every Man, to deſire a Mediatour to come to Chriſt.</hi> They ſhould not have askt <hi>Philip,</hi> but gone directly to Chriſt. O rare diſcoveries! Now let the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt</hi> and <hi>Methodiſt</hi> look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Some muſt bring Humility to Chriſt, that is their Mediatour. They muſt come humble.</hi> Now we are all knockt down: All was Comdemn'd.

               <p>Doct. <hi>That is the Duty of every Man, to deſire to ſee Jeſus the Saviour. Not the Lawgiver, or Commander, for he was no ſuch.

               <p>All Qualifications were Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>And now we are told,</hi> Abraham <hi>was an ungodly Man, long after he was call'd, and believers (after long ſuch) were adviſed to plead the promiſe with God; Lord, thou haſt promis'd to juſtify
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101963:23"/>the ungodly, I came to thee as an ungodly Man, juſtify thou me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An ungodly Believer is Linen-Drapers Divinity. After our New Goſpeller, had Condemn'd all Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, Behold, he is Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis'd into a Legaliſt upon a ſudden. He tells us, <hi>That whoever comes to Chriſt without being ſenſible of his Sin and Miſery, ſhould come in Vain.</hi>—</p>
               <p>What mean theſe Men by <hi>Coming to Chriſt?</hi> Chriſt Calls, are <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.28. <hi>Them that labour and are heavy Laden,</hi> (Not with Ceremonies, as ſome ſay, but ſin and ſorrow) to come to him, His word ſhall ſtand. <hi>They ſhall look on him whom they have Peirced and Mourn,</hi> Zach. 2.7. In its primary intention, reſpects the Converſion of the <hi>Jew,</hi> which <hi>Joſeph Mead</hi> and others, believe will be in the like way, as <hi>Paul</hi> was Converted by a Voice from Heaven, and therefore can only be Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated here. Dare you ſay, There is no way to Mourning but here? I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, a Man may repent aright from Subjects of <hi>Sin, Hell, Judgment to come,</hi> &amp;c. And this will I undertake, and other things, if any reply to this, make it more neceſſary then as yet I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101963:23"/>can ſee it is. More ſtuff there was, in that ſpeaking (not Preaching) which I have forgotten, or care not to mention; I have taken care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult another Miniſter then with me, who once intended to Print the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with Notes, but ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations diverted him. I have not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly err'd in ſenſe nor words. He can teſtify the ſame. One Notion comes on a Sudden, <hi>We muſt not rely on the doctrine, benefits, merits of Chriſt, but his Perſon.</hi> I hope, no Man will expect I ſhould diſparage my ſelf, to Confute his abſurdities. They that cannot, or will not ſee them, diſcover what they are. Might not the Doctrine be,</p>

               <p>I had heard before the madneſs of the Man, againſt all others. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great Gentlewoman this was ſaid, as is fam'd and believ'd. <hi>That the Anabaptiſt dipt Women to feel them in the Water,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The aforemention'd Miniſter, with others, heard him once before on this Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26. <hi>And they were all
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101963:24"/>afraid of him, not believing he was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple:</hi> And this Doctrine was laid down.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That it is a difficult thing for true believers, to believe others are ſo:</hi> When every Child knows the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.

To ſay, <hi>If he was not one, he would have been one, is a poor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> Well, <hi>Paul had the Call of the Spirit without humane Learning</hi>—Why Name I what every Ignoramous can confute, except one? Muſt Women be call'd <hi>wicked Women,</hi> for talking much of <hi>trouble for ſin and fears,</hi> and a Story told, God indeed convinced me, that I was a great Sinner, but I was never troubled for it? I deſired by a kind Letter <hi>This mans Abetters</hi> (ſo accounted) to meet me, and ſome Congregational Miniſters juſtly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with theſe things, to give us a fair Meeting amicably to debate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. That they would give us their Reaſons for his being a Preacher, and

               <p>I would not be miſtaken, I believe the Church of <hi>England,</hi> had never ſo many Learned Men in it as of late Years.

               <p>Not to ſay much of your Diſputes, when <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans</hi> burnt one another; <hi>Jamenuiſts</hi> are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and been deſtroyed as ſuch. A Million of Men in <hi>Italy</hi> have lately run after <hi>Molinus,</hi> that Half Quaker.

What Notions of ours are ſo Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous as Tranſubſtantiation?
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101963:30"/>Pardon me, I call that Doctrine Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, for let me ask you;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Did Chriſt take and eat his own Body? It was well ſaid of him in the <hi>Oxford</hi> Diſputation, it is time ill ſpent to diſpute with them that can ſwallow ſuch Contradictions. This is like the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Story of the Servant, that when his Head was cut off, took him up in his Teeth and buried it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Did the Ancient Chriſtians, who burnt the Bread, left after Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, think they burnt Chriſts Body?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Did ever the Heathen <hi>Julian</hi> in his Epiſtles; or any other, twit the Chriſtians with making a God of a Wafer, and Eating him when all was done? Sure, No, then no ſuch thing was then talkt of, and if not, then it is too late to tell us ſo now.</p>
               <p>For taking away the Cup, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilating the Sacrament, if Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation were true, yet your Story of the Blood being by Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy in the Body, is not ſufficient, will not do: For in the Sacrament we commemorate Chriſt, not living but dying; his Blood not running in his Reins, but ſeparate from them. This <hi>Cup is my Blood ſhed,</hi> this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101963:31"/>made moſt of the Trent <hi>Conventicle</hi> (Pardon the Expreſſion for ſo <hi>Durankin,</hi> hath largely proved it to be, tho he dyed in your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion) almoſt Mad when urg'd by a <hi>Friar,</hi> They flung their Seats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pauls</hi> Hiſt.</p>
               <p>Can the ſame Body and Blood move and not move, be eaten and not eaten at the ſame time? I cannot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and others, that ſay, <hi>Theſe be Contradictions,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictoria non cadunt ſub divina poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> Tho I would take heed how I expreſs my ſelf hear, Remembring what a Heathen, <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid in one of his Orations, <hi>Pauca &amp; timide de Deo Loquimur.</hi> Ye are the Body of Chriſt, faith <hi>Paul.</hi> In my apprehenſion you may as well ſay, The words are plain. Therefore;</p>
               <p>A Man Converted, is the very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that hung on the Croſs. If you ſay our ſenſes tell us, it is the ſame Body in ſubſtance as before; So our ſenſes tell us, the ſame of the Bread: If you ſay, the aſſerting of this would be Monſtrous. Not one jot more then yours, as I could eaſily prove, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.26. <hi>The Seven Ears,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101963:31"/>and Kine are Seven Years.</hi> We ſay look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Picture againſt the Wall, <hi>This is my Father, Brother, Husband, Wiſe.</hi> Some of you confeſs your Doctrine, here cannot be prov'd from Scripture, (tho ſome attempt to do it,) and that we have taken the more favourable ſenſe of the words, had not your Church choſen the contrary.</p>
               <p>I ſay again, Do any of theſe I write of, aſſert ſuch a <hi>Monſtrous Doctrine,</hi> as is <hi>Tranſubſtantiation?</hi> Or do they pray in an <hi>unknown</hi> Tongue? Your Prieſts here in <hi>England,</hi> were more ignorant then ſome Coblers among us. It is well known, one of them reading the Queſtions to the Sponſors, for the Child in Baptiſm, <hi>Anno abrenunciabis Diabolum cum omnibus ſuis operibus?</hi> Wondred how the Devil ſhould get in his Chriſtning Book, he blotted out the word <hi>Diabolum,</hi> and put in <hi>Chriſtum:</hi> So the Queſtion was, <hi>Doſt thou Renounce Chriſt with all his Works?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Baptis'd a Child in <hi>Nomine Patria, Filia &amp; Spiritu ſanctu,</hi> which one conſtrued I baptize with the <hi>Fathers Countrey, the Daughter and the he ſhe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> And it was queſtion'd, whether this ſhould go for a good Baptiſm, but the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101963:32"/>Old <hi>Numpſimus</hi> is better then the New <hi>Sumpſimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pray Gentlemen, How was the Creed ſaid formerly?</p>

                  <q rend="margQuotes">Oh! This is he, that hath talkt of an Impoſſibility, of a Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main trick, of teaching a Child Nine Year old very lately, The

               </p>
               <p>I affirm, and affirm, again, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that it is true, and he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined before Mr. <hi>Woodhouſe,</hi> Mr <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> who know there was no Trick in the thing; as knows well Mr. <hi>Larner,</hi> the Father of the Child. I am ready for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof, if it be doubted or deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I have heard of one that in an Afternoon, taught one to read all that Chapter! wonder at it who will, I do not, but think it feaſable, tho I never tried it. I hear I am in ſome Cabals call'd Lyar, and I know not what; have pity on your ſelves Sirs, if you have none on me; come forth and face me, you that ſmite me in the Dark.</p>
               <p>And now I cloſe this with a few Words to thoſe Congregational Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, whom I plead for.</p>
               <p>You ſee, <hi>Brethren,</hi> That I have once more put my Hand into a Neſt of Waſps for your ſakes, tho' I am not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101963:33"/>of your mind about Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. I own <hi>Presbytery, and the Divine</hi> Right of it. How as my <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> not as an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> and therefore will never plead for it as ſuch only;</p>
               <p>I diſown that little <hi>Creature,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Lay-Elder;</hi> and think, if it be no Creature of God's making, it is a woful one of Man's making. Not that I think the thing ſo novel as ſome do, or no older then <hi>Calvin;</hi> for I am well aſſured, <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that ancient Father, ſays,</p>
               <p>That it was a Church-Officer of Old, but that the Pride or Negligence of Miniſters caſt him out, How far he might be out here, I will not ſay, I am ſure he was in his Expoſition on the 8th of <hi>Romans,</hi> where he ſays, <hi>Olim viri mulieres docebant, &amp; baptizabant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I paay you, Sirs, adviſe your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren not to be eaſily impoſed on by unqualified Men. One wrote me, <hi>He deſired to ſerve God in the Miniſtry, and ſhould be glad if he could do him any good.</hi> They were his Words. When I adviſed him to keep to his Trade, he told me he was my <hi>Convert.</hi> When he had no help from me, he marries a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101963:33"/>rich Wife, took up much plate from the Goldſmith, and ran away. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> was a notorious Example; He was bowed and cringed to, as if a Biſhop; how he lived undeſired for his Covetouſneſs, Oppreſſion, and died unlamented of all, is too well known, as well as his Preaching other Mens Sermons.</p>
               <p>Such Men ſhall talk much of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and what God hath revealed to thoſe <hi>Babes,</hi> and his from the <hi>Wiſe;</hi> and by ſuch Cants the People take them to be Oracles: Juſt as <hi>Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> would have the World believe he had his new Diſcoveries in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, Phyſick, and Divinity, as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired</hi> by God.</p>
               <p>Then he Cants, and then tells of a Dream, of a <hi>great Tree laden with Fruit</hi>— His <hi>Cauſes and Beginning of Natural Things.</hi> 4 Chap. 32.</p>
               <p>Well, after all, we are told what a Horſe is, and it is put into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Chapter, that we may the more note it. <hi>That the Horſe is the Son of his Fourfooted Parents, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the vertue of a Word, into a living, Horſelike Soul.</hi>

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:101963:34"/>
               <p>We have a common Saying in ſome Places, That to hear ſome things would make <hi>a Horſe to break his Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe that Man hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Followers in this City, I ſhall ſay the more of him, and ſee whether he hath not ripled ſome places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for his wild Notions, as our giddy Antinomians have for theirs.</p>
               <p>In his Two Hundred Queries <hi>about the Revolution of Human Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See how this Man, after Prayers to God to diſcover Myſteries to him, moſt vilely and fooliſhly plays with Scripture.</p>
               <p>John 12.35. <hi>Are there not twelve Hours of the Day</hi>— ſaith he tweve ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, <hi>to be born in the World for Man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epheſians</hi> 16. Redeem the time, <hi>not twenty or thirty Years only, but hundreds they bad miſſpent before in other Bodies</hi>—Here is your Man, your Expoſiter for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the Old Man, the Body of Sin? but that which they had, had bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Years</hi>— As weak is the Talk of this Heretick, about the Ending of the Torments of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101963:34"/>Damned; Pride will put Men on ſtrange Deluſions, as if Inſpirations, <hi>Raphiel,</hi> he ſays, was promiſed him in a Dream.</p>
               <p>The things I defend you in, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, are of great Weight and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which all things equally true are not, tho' the Authority of the Revealer be the ſame.</p>
               <p>Broken places of Scripture are us'd by theſe Men with as much Fraud, as by the Devil, 4 <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.6. on Chriſt; yet by the ſame Weapon of Scripture rightly uſed, Chriſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, wounded him, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him.</p>
               <p>One was thoughtful to Print ſome of Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> his Golden Sayings, ſuch Men will <hi>be talking of Men, of Men of Parts</hi>— Was it not a lovely thing to ſee our Linen. Draper in his Experiences, and Confeſſions of Faith, to call Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> a <hi>Block-head, in terminis terminantibus,</hi> which none of his learned Adverſaries that know him will ſay.</p>
               <p>When we hear their Blaſphemy, we may cry, <hi>Hear O Heavens! and be aſtoniſhed, O Earth! bluſh at ſuch
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101963:35"/>things as theſe, to ſee thoſe that neither fear God nor reverence Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be you, Sirs, as great Advocates for Chriſt and Holineſs, as they for Satan and Sin; and perſwade your Hearers timely, and well, to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe their Children, that they may eſcape theſe Birds of Prey.</p>
               <p>We ſee how many, as a flock of Sheep, run over Hedges, or down in the Sea, one after another. It is dangerous to uſe hard Phraſes, which is the putting the Sword in the Hand of Mad-men, to deſtroy others and themſelves with.</p>
               <p>We are told <hi>they Preach well,</hi> ſo they may, when they Preach other <hi>Mens Works,</hi> but many, when their own, make <hi>woful work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Man may Preach nothing in a Sermon but what is true, and yet none of it true, if it be not true <hi>Hinc,</hi> if not <hi>from bence,</hi> it foilows— it is all falſe. Such was the Preaching of our profound Doctor, if I may ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the word <hi>Preaching,</hi> to call a <hi>Meſs of Nonſence</hi> by this Name. Now in abundance of places, we hear the croaking of theſe Frogs.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:101963:35"/>
               <p>I know you, and ſome other <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> Mr. <hi>Veil,</hi> Mr <hi>Glaſcock,</hi> &amp;c. are here in the City, like ſpeckled Bieds, but may they keep up their Courage notwithſtanidng. If it pleaſe them to appear, I ſuppoſe, ſome of us would as ſoon venture the Cauſe in their Hands, as in the Hands of any Men whatever.</p>
               <p>Tho' ſome firſt Independents alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the occaſional Preaching of their Lay-Elders (an intolerable Practice) yet Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> did not, and Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> in his <hi>Keys</hi> cenſures it; for which, indeed, <hi>Philip Nye,</hi> in his Preface cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures him.</p>
               <p>If ſome enquire how I came to have ſo much reſpect for you above ſome others, whoſe Heads and mine bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agree about Diſcipline, I will tell you.</p>
               <p>When I was a Member of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity, I frequented Meetings, and there only, received the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I finding no Presbyterian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation there I deſired good old Dr. <hi>Rogers</hi> to let me ſit down occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with them, without any Tye, which he did. This Man was a very holy good Man; tho, when a young
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101963:36"/>Man, very prophane, for which he was called, Mad <hi>Kit</hi> of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> but on a ſudden, ſtrook to the Heart. He was a grave Man, and wore his Beard long, for which he was often called, when Principal of <hi>New-Inn-Hall, Old Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among other great Things I have heard of him, theſe were ſome:</p>
               <p>That he, a rich Batchelor, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mrs. <hi>Garburn,</hi> a Widow, with Children, and in Debt, and took care of them all. Her Vertues were her Dowry; for ſhe was one of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and moſt devout Women upon Earth: She educated many Gentle wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, taught them an excellent <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,</hi> which ſhe made, and a <hi>Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith</hi> of her own compoſing.</p>
               <p>Another thing was, That being often in the Company of a good Man, Capt. <hi>D.</hi> he found him always ſad and penſive; enquiring into the Cauſe, he was told, he owed above a Hondred Pounds, which he could not pay. The good, kind, compaſſionate Doctor, paid the Money, and takes up the Bond, without ſaying anv thing to the Man. Then comes to viſit him, and asked him, <hi>Why are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101963:36"/>you not pleaſant as you were want to be?</hi> He would not tell; then the Doctor delivered to him the Bond; <hi>Will the ſight of this make you pleaſant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He would often ſay to his good <hi>ſecond</hi> ſelf, We have <hi>much Money in ſuch a Bag; ſuch and ſuch poor People want ſome of it</hi> — Give me ſuch an active Man. I have often wondred, that having ſo many ordinary Lives Printed, the Lives of this Couple were not ſo.</p>
               <p>But I am now on ſudden told, ſome Wits in the City deſign a Lampoon upon me, if I thus proceed, to which I Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What! What! And he Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for our ignorant Linnen-Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? I doubt, I ſhall ſoon prove them, <hi>Witt, Would bee,</hi> as this <hi>Jack a Criſpian Would-bee,</hi> for he underſtands no Mans Principles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is ſent me by an unknown hand already, an Ingenious <hi>Lampoon</hi> upon our Linnen-Draper, which ſome that know him ſay, is an Exact De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his Birth, Parents, manner of Life, ſuch as I have ſeldom heard of. For my part, I abhor all things of that Nature, and was about to ſend
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101963:37"/>it to him with this Declaration: That, I would not uſe much leſs Print, any ſuch Paper. This way of Anſwering betrays any Cauſe whatever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That two <hi>Lampoons</hi> are Printed againſt me already, to which I have given a Sober Reply; Let this be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd before a New one be made. For my part, I keep both their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers by me in the Window to look on, when dull and melancholy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive me. Indeed Gentlemen, Print ſuch <hi>Lampoons</hi> every week, I care not. I am ſo Zealous for the King, and ſo Compaſſionate on Poor Tradeſmen: That if you pleaſe to further the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the King for Paper, or help Printers, and Stationers, and Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, you may; I think all Men now conclude, that read my Defence, That never were more Impudent Lyes told by any Man, then by <hi>B. C.</hi> and <hi>W. C.</hi> Men that are aſhamed to own their Books, tho I not mine. I wonder how they dare to be ſeen among them, that know what they have done. Not one Man comes to me for the proavis'd five Pound, tho a half Year be paſt.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:101963:37"/>

               <p>I Pray my Reader to conſider, if there were ſo many Flaws in that one (and but one) Sermon, I heard from the Reverend <hi>Linen-Draper,</hi> how reaſonable it is to think many more are in other wild Diſcourſes of his; where he makes not ſo great a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration expecting not ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory; yet ſee the Miſery of uncate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed Heads.

               <p>I once lived with a conceited Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Farmer, who would tell me, <hi>If he were in my place, he would make the People quale;</hi> and, <hi>that he knew one who broke a piece of the Board on which he leaned in his Pulpit. O Sirs! What do you mean?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would often tell him that was a Preacher for him, but a Stage-player for me.</p>
               <p>In a place where once I lived, was a Man much followed: <hi>he could Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the hardeſt places of Scripture on a ſuddain.</hi> — One put him that place, <hi>The Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be many days

               </p>
               <p>He once, as is ſaid, patching up a Sermon out of Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Dun,</hi> their Works, one being asked how he liked it, ſaid, <hi>It was featly done.</hi> A preaching Mealman once told me, <hi>You muſt have Ten Shillings a Day, when we ſometimes have but Twelve Pence.

               <p>Our Mechanick Preachers, who think above all Men <hi>they pay it off,</hi> frequently tell us, <hi>I have the Seal of my Miniſtry:</hi> What a madneſs is this?

               <p>I ſtill pray my Reader, if he be a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not to judge of our Meetings, by ſuch Aſſemblies as theſe I condemn.

What art thou, if thou provideſt not for us thy People?</hi> Was not alone in ſuch Folly and Impudence? But perhaps this Story may as much be queſtioned, as that one of them ſaid, <hi>If ever Jeſus Chriſt was D. it was when he made the Lord's Prayer,</hi> which <hi>W.

Read the Anſwer to the <hi>Scottiſh Eloquence,</hi> and ſee how ſome Paſſages are falſe, others want Proof, and Accuſers guilty of the cenſured Folly.</p>

               <p>Might I not be bold to ask ſome Tradeſman, who deſire to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to do good, as they pretend, Do you not as <hi>Ely</hi>'s beggarly Sons, deſire to be put in the Prieſts Office to get a Morſel of Bread! Conſcience, What ſayſt thou?</p>
               <p>It is a heavy Charge laid on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Independents, as if they were like the old Donatiſt, and denied Salvation to any, but to thoſe of their own Conventicle.

               <p>They obſerve. That thoſe who would make iudifferent Things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſoon make neceſſary Things indifferent.

               <p>For his Divinity, he hath declared plainly, That Kneeling in the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord's Supper, after it was laid aſide in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Days, was taken up in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Papiſts, who might come to Church and receive, owning the real Preſence.

               <p>What ails the Gentleman? Was he troubled with the Hickocks? I had replied to it, had I not appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Book as well as he, tho' on different Accounts. Some great Men have ſaid,</p>

               <p n="1">1. NO Church can appoint means of Grace, but may appoint Ceremonies and Liturgies, and other Forms of Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By means of Grace, I mean ſuch things or Actions, to the due performance of which any promiſe of Grace Ghoſtly or Bodily, is Annexed by God. As to the Sacrament of

               <head>THE NONCONS ANSWER.</head>
               <p>IT ſeems to me, unlawful for any Church to impoſe on Miniſters of the Goſpel, any Liturgy to be us'd in Publick Adminiſtrations, eſpecially ſo defective a one as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe in the infancy of the Church, in its Nonage, when God taught it by many Rituals, till it came to maturity, or full Age as a Man, he appointed no Forms of Prayer then to be ſaid, much leſs read. It cannot be ſuppoſed, but the Prieſts in their Sacrifices and other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, as they taught the People
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101963:63"/>the ſignification and uſe of them, and ſo were as the Mouth of God to them, ſo they ſolemnly Pray'd to God, as the Mouth of the People to him. Now if God then made no Prayer Book for them, who dares impoſe one now on the Miniſters of the Goſpel, a better Miniſtration or Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe they tend to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Miniſterial Abilities this way, and ſeem to be contrary to the Apoſtles Command, <hi>Stir up the Gift of God in thee.</hi> He that officiates, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have Gifts fit for his work. If he hath, he muſt uſe them; if he hath not, what hath he to do with that office? What is a Phyſitian or Lawyer, if unable to ſpeak aptly to, or for his Patient or Client.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the ſame Prayers ſuited to ſome Emergencies, or occaſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be to all. New Sins, New Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, New Temptations, New Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, New Mercys require ſuch particular Confeſſions, Deprecations, Petitions, Praiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That old ſet Forms will not ſerve for.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:101963:63"/>
               <p n="4">4. Reading Prayers to God, we read nothing of in Scripture, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancients. This hinders Devotion when the Eyes are nail'd on a Book, that ſhould be ſo to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Common Prayer Book ſeems to be full of Incoherencies, and Tautologies, unwarrantable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions by the People, who in Church Stated Worſhip were to ſay (ordinarily) no more then <hi>Amen,</hi> or what is equivalent to it. Womens ſpeaking alſo is (ordinarily) forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, except in Singing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which <hi>Joſeph Mead,</hi> and Others think is meant by the word <hi>Propheſie.</hi> Here the Lords Prayer is ſaid over, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter again; the King prayed for, after other Petitions he is prayed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, then the Lord's Prayer again, after the King again, and ſo on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spmbolicol Ceremonies in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ought not to be impos'd, much leſs yours, for theſe Reaſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe, when it pleaſed God to teach the Church this way, by-Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101963:64"/>he made them himſelf. <hi>Moſes</hi> (of all Men moſt dear to God) was not intruſted to make one of them, much leſs <hi>Aaron,</hi> or the Civil Governours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It cannot be rationally imagin'd, that God intended to lay aſide Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Divine Appointment, to make way for Ceremonies of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Appointment. May Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion now be uſed, if Appointed only as Commemorative; or Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant of Circumciſing the Heart? Or might a Lamb be ſlain to put in mind of Chriſt ſlain, if injoyn'd by the Church or Magiſtrate, tho' not as an Ordinance of God, or means of Grace to work any Ghoſtly or Spiritual Good, as promis'd by God? Might ſprinkling with Holy-water be thus us'd, as only ſignifying the waſhing away of Sin, if thus injoyn'd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Surplice and Croſs are made as Lay-mens Books, by putting in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance by ſome notable Sign to Edifie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> great Vertue is aſcrib'd to the laſt. The Croſs is not only Symbolical, but Dedicatory.</p>
               <p>It is no Sign between one Church-Member
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101963:64"/>and another, but between him and God. By this Sign is the Child ſaid to be Dedicated to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of him that Dyed upon the Croſs. Who may be ſo bold to make Signs of this Nature to God?</p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſeem contrary to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles command, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order.</hi> I would deſire no better Text againſt them then this you all urge for them. What a Phantaſtical Dreſs doth a Surplice ſeem to be, unbecoming the Gravity of a Goſpel Miniſter?</p>
               <p>Can it be ſuppos'd the Apoſtle who laid down this Golden Rule, uſed any of your Ceremonies, or ſuch as yours? How comes your Decency to be us'd in the Desk, and to be laid aſide when you aſcend the Pulpit? Is God to be worſhipped with Decency in the one, and without it in the other.</p>
               <p>Doth not the Apoſtle Cenſure Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Speaking, Singing diverſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> together, which were not things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or things done in order?</p>
               <p>The Decency injoyn'd by <hi>Paul</hi> was ſuch as the Law of God, and Nature
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101963:65"/>requir'd as agreeable to them, and therefore was Antecedently neceſſary to his Injuction and Practice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Things neceſſary in <hi>Genere</hi> may be determin'd by Human Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, what they ſhall be in <hi>Specie,</hi> as Time, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not what is not ſo, or thus neceſſary, as Sacred Veſtments, or Acceſſory ſigns, to ſigns of Divine Appointment.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God appointed no Forms of Prayer for them (the Jews) to be ſaid, much leſs read.</p>
               <p>Anſwer 1. If the Church hath Power to impoſe Forms of Prayer, ſhe is alſo judge of the time when to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them.</p>
               <p>Therefore, They were not impoſed then, is no Argument why they may not be impoſed now.</p>

And the <hi>Pſalms</hi> were of daily uſe in the Temple, and were impoſed as a Form by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:101963:66"/>29. as <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Lamentation upon <hi>Joſiah,</hi> Chap. 35.25. The Jews in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſent a Form of Prayer to thoſe in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be read in their Solemn Worſhip, <hi>Bar.</hi> 1, 14, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that was taken out of that Form, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. with Additions reſpecting their preſent caſe. The 136 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> was a uſual Form of Thankſgiving, like the <hi>Te Deum</hi> now in uſe: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find the <hi>Pſalm</hi> uſed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13.7.3.20.21. <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.2. and tho the Repetition of each Verſe is only named, it was the Name of the <hi>Pſalm;</hi> as when we ſay, the <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung, the meaning is not, Thoſe two Words only, but the whole Hymn, which is ſo called from thoſe Words which are in it. And that Form, whoſe Title is mentioned <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.35. was repeated; and more of it told by <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 132.8. And again in the ſame Words by <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.41.</p>
               <p>As the Jews always had, they ſtill have a Liturgy. <hi>George Keith</hi> can help you to the ſight of one; and if your Curioſity leads you to ſpeak with any of them, of their uſe of it, how long it hath been with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:101963:67"/>
               <p>But Laſtly. Since Schiſm is a great Sin confeſt on all hands, nothing can excuſe our running into Schiſm, but the Impoſition of what it plainly and poſitively a Sin.</p>
               <p>Therefore it lies on you to prove,
<list>
                     <item>1. That a Liturgy is unlawful. Or,</item>
                     <item>2. That Men may run into Schiſm to avoid what is not unlawful.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This brings the Matter to a ſhort Iſſue, and will make my Anſwer very ſhort to the other Reaſons, which are at moſt but Inconveniences, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſufficient Cauſes for Schiſm.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon you urge is, That it weakneth Miniſters Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. No, there is liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſtir up the Gift in his own Prayer unpreſcribed, before and after Sermon, and upon ſeveral other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. This is no ſufficient Cauſe for Schiſm.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:101963:67"/>
               <p n="3">3d Reaſon yom give, is that in the Liturgy; There are not Prayers ſuited for all Emergencies.</p>
               <p>Anſwer 1. Theſe may be ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Miniſters Prayer, which is not preſcribed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Particular Offices are made for extraordinary Occaſions</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moſt ordinary Occaſions are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in the Liturgy; as Plague, War, Famine, Rain, Drought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is no ſufficient Cauſe for Schiſm.</p>
               <p>Your 4th Reaſon is, That we read not of Liturgies, or Forms in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or among the Ancients, and that it hinders Devotion.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. The firſt part of this Reaſon is anſwered above; That we do read it both in Scripture, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ancients.</p>
               <p>As to the Second. That it hinders Devotion. It may be ſo at firſt to Perſons prejudie'd, or unaccoſtom'd.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101963:68"/>But the Experience of others doth witneſs, that it is a great help to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to them, and much more moving than Extemporary Effuſions, (that are as much a Form to the Hearers,) but however the Debate goes, this is no ſufficient cauſe for Schiſm, unleſs it were poſitively for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Your fifth Reaſon objects ſomthing to be mended in the Form of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, pretended Incoherencies, Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies, Repetitions: If all which were granted, are no cauſe for Schiſm. And ſuch Objections might be made againſt the 136 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where are more Repetitious, than any in our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy. But Repetitions are ofther found in the Extemporary way.</p>
               <p>But however this be determin'd, there is no ſufficient cauſe for Schiſm, for that is the Point which I perſue.</p>
               <p>The Second Branch of your Paper is, That Symbolical Ceremonies in Divine Worſhip ought not to be impos'd.</p>
               <p>But before I come to the Reaſons, let me premiſe this, That there are
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101963:68"/>many things, which ought not to be in Prudence impoſed, and yet when impoſed, are not a ſufficient Ground for Schiſm.</p>
               <p>Now to the Reaſons.</p>
               <p>To the firſt <hi>three,</hi> I Anſwer. Are not Feaſts, and Faſts, Symbolical things? For this reaſon they deny to the Church power to impoſe them, at leaſt Annually. Now the Feaſt of <hi>Purim, Eſther</hi> 9.27; <hi>The faſts of the fifth, and the ſeventh months. Zach.</hi> 4.5. <hi>And the feaſt of the Dedication,</hi> 1. <hi>Mac.</hi> 1.59. were Ordain'd by the Church, and Annually; and our Saviour honour'd the laſt with His Preſence, <hi>Job.</hi> 10.12. Which had it been unlawful, he would not have done, but rather have Reproved it.</p>
               <p>Again, Circumciſion was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for an initiating Sign or Right. The Jews added Baptiſm long before Chriſt came, and they Baptized as well as Circumciſed their Proſylites. But our Saviour found no fault with this: Nay, on the contrary, He went on with and continued it; <hi>John</hi> was ſent to Baptize: and Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Baptiſm for the initiating Form of his Church. The <hi>Jews</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101963:69"/>of Baptiſm was more Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and Dedicating, than you can Alledge upon the Croſs in Baptiſm, eſpecially, conſidering that we make it not Eſſential to Baptiſm, which is demonſtrated, in that it is not to be uſed in the Office of Private Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Your fourth Reaſon, That a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice is a Phantaſtical Dreſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming the Gravity of a Goſpel Miniſter, is <hi>Gratis dictum.</hi> Every Country is Maſter of its own Faſhions and Dreſſes, and that is unbecoming, and indecent in one Country, that is not ſo in another, which is becoming and decent in another.</p>
               <p>There is nothing in Nature to make White more than Black, or Black more than White to be decent, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent. If you ſay there is, you lay more ſtreſs upon. Colours than we do, and ſo will fall into the ſame Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiaion, you accuſe us with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> It is hard to call that colour Phantaſtical, which God himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the Prieſts under the Law: And wherein Angels appeared, and Chriſt himſelf in His Transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Or to ſay, It is unbecoming the Gravity of a Goſpel Preacher, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:101963:69"/>
               <p>Your fifth Reaſon. That things neceſiary in <hi>Genere,</hi> may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in <hi>Specie</hi> by Human Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doth juſtifie our practiſe in this, for we do no more. Veſtments are neceſſary in <hi>Genere,</hi> the colour, or ſhape of them is no other then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of them in <hi>Specie,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you can ſhew a poſitive Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the wearing of White, it is as lawful as Black, or ony other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. However, without ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, whatever Opinion, or Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy you or I may have as to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of it, there can be no Ground upon this Account for Schiſm, or for us to make Rents in the Church, which is a tearing of Chriſt's Body to pieces.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A few Hours after the <hi>Noncon</hi> ſent him the following Reply.</head>
               <p>THat Arguments are not anſwer'd, is a common Complaint, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten where there is leaſt occaſion, you think, I have not anſwered yours, I think I have, you think, (no doubt,) you now have anſwered mine; perhaps, I think, you have not; every thing of our own gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally appears to us great, tho neve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101963:70"/>little; and every thing of others againſt us, appears little, tho never ſo great. I therefore care not for words of that nature.</p>
               <p>If the Church can impoſe any thing ſhort of what you call means of Grace. It might impoſe Circumciſion, Holy Water for a Symbolical Sign, only as I wrote. Such Repetitions, you know are tedious.</p>
               <p>I did deny plainly your Poſition, and am ready for more proof. You then produced not your Arguments for your Aſſertion, which now you do, and I thought it not Civility in me to Anticipate them.</p>
               <p>The Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> had no power to impoſe Liturgies, or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies under the Law. God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where forbad the making of the like by the art of the <hi>Apothecary, &amp;c.</hi> (I have no Concordance by me,) He charged them not to add, as not to diminiſh. Therefore the Church hath no power now. Where is her Charter? If God ſaw it not fit to make Prayers for the Prieſts, to be read by them, but they Prayed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ability God gave them. He ſees it not fit to do it now: when
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101963:70"/>greater Abilities are given to Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſters now than to them of the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> More Knowledge to Chriſtians now, than to the <hi>Jews</hi> then. The Veil is taken away.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion was of impoſed Forms to be read by the Prieſts; and you anſwer to a Declaration made by a private Perſon. <hi>Deu.</hi> 26.5. Do you think indeed they were tyed to Words or Senſe? or that they took out a Paper or Prayer Book, and read. I uſe the word <hi>Ordinary,</hi> for as ſome manage that, and other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it might prove <hi>Lay-mens</hi> Praying, yea, and Preaching too in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.35. ſeems to me as little. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ergo,</hi> What? God made Forms of Prayer, or Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. Did he read that ſhort Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? I do not think, you believe he ever did. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. was not a Prayer ſure. If ſuch were found in your Liturgy, Men would ſay of you, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, ſome would ſay, <hi>That ſaw men pray in an unknown tongue.</hi> That was a Song or Pſalm, which may be Hiſtorical, Doctrinal, Prophetical, as well as Petitionary. Many other Anſwers might be given
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101963:71"/>to this. The Expreſſion there were not uſed together, but ſome Words on one occaſion, ſome on another. This was not a Prayer made for the Prieſts; much leſs in Sacrificing. That was the Queſtion. But the firſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ss ſufficient, and I care as little as any Man for ſupernumerary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. The firſt ſeems to me clear, but I will not ſay <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconfuteable,</hi> conſidering whom I have to deal with.</p>
               <p>I remember, I have heard of a Judge, who demanding the reaſons of one Man's not Appearing at the Court, as he was required the Aſſizes before. One anſwered, <hi>My Lord, there are twelve Reaſons. The firſt is, the Man is Dead, and therefore could not come. Secondly.— Nay, ſtop Friend,</hi> ſaid the Judge, <hi>keep the other Eleven to thy ſelf; that one is ſufficient.</hi> I think of this ſometimes when writing.</p>
               <p>Did I ever Queſtion worthy Sir, whether ever God made or impos'd Forms of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> that you tell me were uſed in the Temple? No ſure, I thought Singing and Praying had been diſtinct Duties. Elſe ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh where is no difference. God made theſe Forms under the Law, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101963:71"/>reinforced them in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> &amp; without his <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> the thing had been an Abomination, as would have been once Circumciſion and the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and now Baptiſm and the Lords Supper without this. You urge; 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 29.30. I Anſwer, we doubt not but the Church may require what God hath Commanded, for it is there ſaid, <hi>All was done by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King from the Mouth of the Lord,</hi> Chap. 31.25. The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Lamentations</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and therefore what <hi>Jeremy</hi> did, he did from God. As what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did, they did from Chriſt, who in his 40 Days Converſing with them, after his Reſurrection, taught them the things, pertaining to the Kingdom of God, that is, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> required the People to uſe Scripture. (The <hi>Lamentations,</hi>) Therefore what, I know not who may make Prayers, (and broken ones too) for them who have a readineſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves to God as occaſion is. I will not ſay, the Argument taken from the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> look's like a lamentable Argument, it is not Grave
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101963:72"/>enough in it ſelf, and therefore not fit to be written to ſo Grave a Man. For, 1 <hi>Bar.</hi> 14.15. I am ſo much a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and ſo little a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> that I ſlight it. We can no more know the Mind of God by the Practiſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> than the Mind of Chriſt by the Practiſe of the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or ſome others, who would take it ill, to be named with them. God's mind is my enquiry, not their practiſe. Forms of Prayer came from <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſay you, you ſhall have it, ſay I. The reading <hi>Apocraphal Books</hi> in Churches, <hi>Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Eccles. Pol.</hi> could hardly forbear Cenſureing it. I think it was one of the moſt Deviliſh deſigns Satan ever had, to clap thoſe Books at the end of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> to ridicule the whole. To ſay nothing of the Book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> or <hi>Eſdras,</hi> which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would hardly undertake to plead for. I ſtick not to ſay of the admired Book of <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> (ſaid by ſome to be ſo much like Inſpir'd Writings.) That the <hi>Author</hi> was a grand <hi>R</hi> — who tells us of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Prayer to God, that he might Govern according to the Example of <hi>David</hi> his Father. Muſt the Writings of <hi>Philo,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:101963:72"/>written after the <hi>Jews</hi> were unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, an unbelieveing, lying Prophet, be read with Canonical Scripture, and as Leſſons? Let us bring in <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Journal next. I could ſay much of the Book <hi>Bar.</hi> you cite, were it convenient. You urge <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>Ergo,</hi> What? Men muſt pray, not read, and that according to the Ability God gives, would be a better Conſequence than what it is brought for. 136 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> you urge, I ſay It was a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and for your <hi>Te Deum, keep us this day without Sin;</hi> had need be well qualified to keep Men from <hi>Quaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt Dotages</hi> about a Sinleſs State. 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 5.3. Proves not it was the ſame <hi>Pſalm.</hi> If it were, it proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our Argument, much leſs 7 <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. Did <hi>David</hi> never ſay but in that <hi>Pſalm; For he is good, and his mercy endureth for ever?</hi> 20 <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. The Argument is <hi>ejuſdem farinae.</hi> ſo <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.11. Your Opinion is only aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a common Saying, not proved. If it were, no more would follow but this; that the ſame <hi>Pſalm</hi> may be often ſung, which no Man denies. <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.35. compared by you with 163 <hi>Pſalm</hi> 8. Induceth me to think,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101963:73"/>they uſed not the ſame Words, but ſome; and the other place proves it 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 6.41. The uſe of a Sentence or two upon extraordinary occaſions appointed by God, will not prove the uſe of Set, Solemn, many Prayers in all Publick Adminiſtrations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> never had a <hi>Liturgy;</hi> the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> was hardly ever plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Argument by the Old, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Advocates for the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> but by ſome late, and leſs judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Writers. I remember, I have heard that Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> was about to Print in <hi>Oxon</hi> a Liturgy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to prove they had one under the Law, but it was ſtopt from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Preſs, being proved to be made by them ſince their Apoſtacy. Of all Men under Heaven, none care to go to the preſent <hi>Jews</hi> for a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Worſhip, unleſs ſuch as love indecency and diſorder, inſtead of the contrary ſo much talkt of.</p>
               <p>What you write of <hi>Schiſm</hi> 1 won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, what Church invite, and call you me to? Is not the preſent Church Sciſmatical according to ſome Men? But I will not harp on that.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101963:73"/>String. Will you ſtand to Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>'s Determination of Schiſm, of whoſe Opinion I am? And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the now called (but falſly ſo) <hi>Church of England,</hi> is a notorious Schiſmatical one, from the Old one in Doctrine, Diſcipline and Manners. They are alike in impoſing unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things, (ſuſpiciouſly evil, if not really ſo,) which <hi>Paul</hi> would not do on them, he knew could not comply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Schiſm</hi> doth not ſignifie primarily by <hi>Paul,</hi> any Separation from a Church, but Heats, and Uſeleſneſs in it, for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did not erect Altar againſt Altar. Saith <hi>Paul, That there be no ſchiſm in the body, but that the members take care one of another.</hi> That Miniſter, who Preacheth not in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon— is a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> while Preaching againſt <hi>Schiſm.</hi> Members of a Church that are not forward for acts of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> are <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> Alienation of Affection was condemned by <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What you mean by plainly and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively a Sin, I am not ſure. What if it be ſo by Conſequence? What if I have a doubtful Conſcience about it? Muſt I be Damned to obey the Church?</p>

               <p>I pray, Sir, when ſaw you any one Perſon, Miniſter, or Hearer, ſhed one Tear, or Sigh at the <hi>Common-Prayer?</hi>

               <p>Whether all that is ſaid by ſome of the Jews Baptiſing of Proſylites be true, I will not ſay; if true, I have ever been of Opinion, they ſinn'd, and it was an Abomination. They were forbid to add, as well as diminiſh. Good Sir ſpeak plainly, might they have appointed Circumciſion, if God had not done it? That Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Baptiſm from this Practiſe of theirs, ſounds hard with me, and can no more be prov'd than, that Chriſt appointed Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper from the <hi>Corybantes,</hi> or ſuch as they.

               <p>To ſay you make not the Croſs

               <p>THere are ſeveral Paſſages which do well deſerve to be animadverted upon, but I paſs all to purſue our main point till that be ſettled, and then we will proceed as you ſee cauſe. For as to the Reaſon, uſe, and advantage of our Liturgy, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not time to come to that, till we have firſt conſider'd; whether the impoſing theſe be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe for Schiſm, becauſe, if it be not all the inconveniences, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties which you objected, were they granted, will not excuſe your ſeparation from the Church, or make your ſeparation not to be a Schiſm.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:101963:79"/>
               <p>In order to this I firſt ſet down the Power (as I conceive) the Church hath not, <hi>Viz.</hi> To appoint means of Grace, and by this I cut off moſt of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Church hath Power to appoint Ceremonies, or Rights of an inferior order to this.</p>
               <p>This you ſeem to deny, and build upon the Command of not adding to, or diminiſhing from the Law of God.</p>
               <p>But to add to the Law of God, is to add ſomething as the Law of God, which is not. For if I add ſome Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony or Circumſtance, unleſs I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that it is the Law of God, or a part of it, it is no addition to the Law.</p>
               <p>Teaching for Doctrines the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men, this is an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Gods Law, when I teach the Commandments of Men as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, that is as Laws of God, but to teach the Commandments of Men, only as the Commandments of Men, this is not teaching them as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and ſo no addition to the Law of God.</p>
               <p>Thus for Example, when we teach the uſe of a Surplice only as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of Men, we add not to the Law. But if you forbid a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101963:80"/>as a thing unlawful, tho com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by humane Laws, then you teach this as a Doctrine, and ſo you, not we, add to the Law of God: For forbidding is as much a Law of God as injoyning.</p>
               <p>Now then there are but too things to make our Ceremonies or Rights unlawful, and conſequently which can juſtify a ſeparation on their Account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If they are forbidden in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we teach them as Doctrines and Laws of God; and ſeeing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe are the Caſe, I ſee no third thing that can juſtify a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon this Account. Let us keep cloſe to this point till we have ended it. Let us ſettle to our ſelves ſome Rule, by which we muſt govern our ſelves in this important enquiry.</p>
               <p>Now give me leave to take notice of ſome Paſſages in your Paper which relate to theſe. For the other, I paſs by as I ſaid at firſt.</p>
               <p>You ſay, that with us, no Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, no Sacrament. No Croſs, no Baptiſm. Nay, tho the Salvation of Infants dying without it be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, yet run a Riſque here, rather than go without the Croſs; Good
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101963:80"/>God (ſay you) What madneſs doth ſuperſtition lead Men to? Now might I not juſtly return this Exclamation? What will prejudice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Make Men believe! For in the Office of private Baptiſm, which is, particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Children that are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Death, the Croſs is not uſed: And whoever uſeth it in private Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, tranſgreſſeth the Rubrick and the Common Prayer, which is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that our Church doth not think the Croſs neceſſary in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or to be a part of it. Yet you bring this as an Argument, that ſhe did think it neceſſary, and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as to Riſque a Child dying without Baptiſm, rather then go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Croſs.</p>
               <p>As great a miſtake is That of No Kneeling, no Sacrament. Every day it is given to Sick Perſons without Kneeling, and where there is any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable excuſe it will not be exacted.</p>
               <p>But let me ask you, will you give it in your Church to one that doth Kneel? If not, as I believe you will tell me, I am ſure others have, then you lay greater ſtreſs upon the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture then we do. You teach it as a Doctrine abſtracted from humane
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101963:81"/>Laws; we reach it injoyn'd only as a Law of Men, and ſo alterable by Men, and to oblige no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>You ſay of the <hi>Jews</hi> Inſtitution of Baptiſm that they find in it, and that it was an Abomination.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, I beſeech you, if it had been ſo, was it not at leaſt highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that Chriſt would ſome where or other have reprov'd it? Would not ſome mark of Gods diſpleaſure, have been expreſt againſt it? But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Would God have honour'd it ſo greatly as to have complyed with it, to have Countenanced it ſo far, as to ſend <hi>John</hi> to Baptize? Would Chriſt himſelf have ſubmitted to it, to be Baptis'd himſelf? Would he have inſtituted Baptiſm, as the initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Form of his Church, for any to be eſtabliſht in it?</p>
               <p>But on the other hand, if the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Church appointed Baptiſm and joyn'd it to Circumciſion, upon the admiſſion of Proſylites, as we do the Croſs, not as a Sacrament appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but as the Inſtitution of the Church only, and that this was not adding to the Law of God, or found fault with by God. I think you will find no inſtitution of our Church,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101963:81"/>but what you muſt excuſe by the ſame Rule: And if Chriſt ſhew'd the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and obligation that laid on all, to ſubmit to the Inſtitutions of the Church, to ſay; That it became him to fulfil all Righteouſneſs, ſpeaking of the Baptiſm which he was to receive, it will teach us a greater Veneration for the Authority of the Church, then is commonly thought of. Would he have called Baptiſm Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, if in its firſt inſtitution it had been Sin and an Abomination?</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other Particulars in the Paper I ſhould have ſpoke to, but theſe come up to the point in hand. And the hurry I am in at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, made me miſlay your Paper, and now hardly gives me time to run this over in haſte. When this point is once ſettled between us, I will go with you afterwards to what other you think fit, and according to my Ability deal upon the Square with you.</p>

               <p>I think, vaſt is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, not doing a neceſſary Lawful Action, thro tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the doing an unlawful one thro miſtake.</p>

               <p>I meant, No Croſs, no Publick Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, no Kneeling, no Publick Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and doubted not you muſt have ſo underſtood, tho you ſeem not to do ſo. For that Private Baptiſm you mention when a Child is like to dye. I ever thought it an unlawful thing; the ſome of ours as well as
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:101963:83"/>yours too often practiſe it. It ſeems to me a Bloody Sacrifice, and ſuch Miniſters to forget what God ſays, <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice.</hi> This Cuſtom I doubt not, hath been the Death of many Children; ſome have been dying, others quite dead whilſt Baptizing. Oh! ſuch in my Opinion, make an Idol of Baptiſm The Jews in a caſe of neceſſity went 40 Years without Circumciſion in the Wilderneſs. That Cuſtom appears alſo to me as bad, of giving the Lords Supper to ſome ſick Men. Did you never hear of ſome dying, others dead with the Bread in their Mouths? O horrid Prophaning of ſo great and ſacred an Ordinance of Chriſt!</p>
               <p>But what if Parents think the Croſs unlawful, and the Children live or dye in Infancy without it? What if Men cannot be convinc'd but that Kneeling is unlawful, and an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Symbolizing with Popiſh Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Muſt theſe go without the Lords Supper all their Days, tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fo Pious, Humble, and Inquiſitive? Muſt they go without Baptiſm? I am unwilling to repeat excellent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages out of famous <hi>Davenant de Frat, Communione,</hi> perhaps you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101963:83"/>them. Some <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> do give the Sacrament to them that deſire to kneel; they that do not, refuſe it, becauſe they think it to be a Sin, and the Receiver cannot ſay they take it to be a Duty.</p>
               <p>If all be true, (which I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt) about the Jews admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proſylites by Baptiſm, as well as Circumciſion, it will not follow it is juſtified becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> condemned it not for Chriſt never condemned the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitous Lives of the <hi>Eſſenſe,</hi> Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, or Practical, which <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and others ſpeak of at large. No, not ſo much as name them, which hath given occaſion to ſome (fooliſhly I think) to queſtion whither ever there was ſuch a Sect. Neither doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me, Chriſt appointed Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm from the Jewiſh Cuſtom, if taking it for granted ſuch there was; but from the aptneſs of the Sign to the thing ſignified. What then, was the <hi>Baptiſm of</hi> John <hi>thus from men, not from heaven?</hi> Chriſt calls Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (not Mans) Righteouſneſs, 3. <hi>Mat.</hi>

               <p>Now Sir, I come to ſay more to your great Queſtion, whether your Ceremonies, or Worſhip be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101963:84"/>in Scripture, or our <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> free from Schiſm? Some things are forbidden in Scripture, more particularly, ſome more generally, ſome by good conſequence, others more directly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be ye not the ſervants of men;</hi> if your Injunctions were indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet the impoſing them on the <hi>weak</hi> is forbidden 14 <hi>Rom.</hi> What Man on Earth can take me off from <hi>Pauls</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination at large. <hi>Let us judge one another no more;</hi> a Chapter as if writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on purpoſe againſt your <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.</hi> 2 <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 14.

               <p>What worſe Names do yours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that are of a baſe Deſcent, and Badges of abominable Superſtitions. If I muſt have Ceremonies, give me the Old Jewiſh ones, of Gods own making, that were once good, not

               <p>If it becomes not a grave, chaſt Matron, to be found in a Whoriſh Dreſs, it becomes not us to uſe Maſs Prieſts Sacred Garments. What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols, deſerves conſideration here.</p>

               <p>Are Seven Years ſpent in a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-School, and Seven more in the Univerſity, to bring a Miniſter to this paſs to be a Reader, and a lazy Prelates Curate?</p>
               <p>Who now examines before Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Sacrament, or keeps off the Scandalous? Who are they that have Ears (if not Mouths) for all Diſcourſe?

Guilty of what? There are other Guilts beſides that of adding to Gods Law; and even as to Ceremonies, they may be too many, inſignificant and burdenſome, and men may lay too great ſtreſs upon them, beyond the Nature of the things, and yet come not to the length of adding them to Gods Law, which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did by thoſe traditions, which they ſaid, were delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> on the Mount, and deſcended orally down to their times, and therefore of as great Authority as the Written Law, which gave occaſion to the oral traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Again, ſome of their traditions did point blank, contradict the Law of God, as that of <hi>Corban, Mat.</hi> 15.6. And ſome, tho not contradicting the Law of God, yet in practice were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to the Law of God, and theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101963:89"/>our Saviour did confirm, only Corrected the abuſe. Theſe things ye ought to have done ſaid he, but not to leave the other undone. Now there are ſeveral Errors men may commit, as to the Ceremonies, but all are not alike, all may be reprehended and redreſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd with the decency and regard which is due to our Superiors: But all are not ſufficient cauſe for Schiſm, and that is the only point which I now purſue. I ſay, none are a ſufficient cauſe for Schiſm, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe which are injoyn'd as part of Gods Law, or which are appointed as means of Grace, which includes both the former.</p>
               <p>There may be many burdenſome and inconvenient Laws of the Land, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs may be ſought in theſe, yet they are not a ſufficient cauſe to take up Arms and Rebel againſt the State; and ſo it is in the Church. Nothing can be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe, but where ſomething is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of God, is impos'd as a condition of Communion, for if it be not impos'd on me, I may ſtill joyn in Communion without Sin, and then I ought ſo to joyn, and it is a ſin not to joyn: As if an impious Law were enacted in the State, yet I ought not to Rebel for this, only if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on me, I ought to refuſe it, and ſo it is in the Church.</p>
               <p>There is no cauſe for Rebellion in the Church, that is not as ſufficient for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the State. You urge the Oath of a Church-Warden, as a cauſe. f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

And the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath ſet us free, is from the Bondage of that Law Chriſtian Liberty muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to give every man Liberty to do what he pleaſeth, or to free men from the Lawful Commands of Superiors, therefore no conſequence can be drawn from this Text, to warrant Schiſm upon this Account of our Ceremonies, unleſs they be prov'd to be unlawful, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to be impos'd as Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. Reſpects the Caſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons, Judging one another in things left to their Liberty, but not to oppoſe the Lawful Commands of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, eſpecially ſo as to make a Schiſm upon that Account, the hand Writing of ordinances mention'd, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Was the Curſe of the Law due to us for Sin, which Chriſt Nailed to his Croſs, as is plain from</hi> ver. 13. <hi>and hath no Relation to that which we enquire after?</hi> Theſe are all the Scriptures you produce, to juſtify ſeparation on the Account of Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>You object a neglect of Examination before the Sacrament, but this is clear, is no ſufficient cauſe for Schiſm, and it may be beſt amended without ſeparation by admoniſhing of others, and ſhewing them a good Example. Our Rubrick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it: And therefore they are Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts to our Church who do not practiſe it.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>That ſanctification by a Mans own Free will, Justification by a Mans own Righteouſneſs, Salvation by his own good works is not bad Doctrine now.</hi> I know not where you have heard it; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contrary to our Articles and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies which all our Clergy ſubſcribe, and if any teach otherwiſe, let them An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it: They are therein <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist,</hi> becauſe not conformable to the Doctrine of the Church, and here can be no cauſe of Schiſm, becauſe no ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but the contrary is impos'd as a Term of Communion at leaſt to the Clergy.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:101963:92"/>
               <p>What you ſay of <hi>Parker, Stillingſten, Hales,</hi> is nothing to our buſineſs. They are but private Doctors, and there can be no cauſe of Schiſm here. Would you think that <hi>Baxters</hi> Life were a ſufficient cauſe, were there no other to make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Communion, of which he was a Member. You ſay, The Church's Power to appoint Ceremonies was not in the Thirty Nine Articles. What if it was, or was not, doth that make them unlawful? Or is that a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe for Schiſm, for remember, that is our point.</p>
               <p>Your Condemning private Baptiſm, as unlawful to a child in danger of Death, is a Vindication of the Preface to the Diſcourſe of Baptiſm, for which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath been blamed as doing wrong to the Diſſenters, in ſuggeſting, that they laid not ſo much upon Baptiſm as we do. But this is not our preſent Subject, and I will not digreſs. You ſay, Chriſt did not appoint Baptiſm from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. He certainly continued the cuſtom which they had begun, and if the cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om had been finful, and abominable as you ſay, it is not to be imagined that he would have given that countenance to it, inſtead of Reproving it.</p>
               <p>You ſay, Things of a civil nature, common to others, as well as Chriſtians, to other actions, as well as Religious, (as Love Feaſts, Kiſs of Charity,) may be done without Divine Appointment, our Anti-Ceremonial men grant to all the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101963:90"/>World. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That the Love Feaſts and Kiſs of Charity, were uſed in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip is certain; indeed, Love and Feaſting, Kiſſing and Charity too, are things of a Civil Nature in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or common uſe of them, but when they were appointed in Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they became of a Religious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: All actions, or things are of a civil or Religious Nature, as they are uſed to a Religious, or civil uſe. As Muſick in the Church, or out of the Church, are of the ſame nature as to it ſelf, but it receives a different denomination, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different uſes it is put to. with the ſame Tongue we perform Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Woſhip, and at other times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane God. Now, I would gladly know a reaſon why Muſick, or a Surplice might not be uſed in Religious Worſhip, as well as Kiſſing, or Feaſting.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you to conſider impartially, and let us proceed upon Principles, and Reaſons, and not upon Paſſion and Prejudice which blind the Eyes of wiſe Men. But put things to the utmoſt, if any cannot overcome his Scruples againſt Muſick, for example, Let him go to the Church where it is not uſed, which are many in the Kingdom; and however, he may think it inconvenient, unleſs he can prove it poſitively forbidden by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by neceſſary conſequence, here is no ground for Schiſm, for that is our point.</p>

I my ſelf, Sirs, have long ſince read Histories bearing</hi> Fox's <hi>name, which I and others then thought to be his, but he ſent, as I am well informed, to the two</hi> Lyd<hi>'s in</hi> Wales, <hi>and other Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, to make ſuch Books, and he would put his Name to them He alſo ſays, That the</hi> Story of one <hi>Brown,</hi> that <hi>Fox</hi> ſay<hi>s</hi> had Viſions and Revelations, concerning him what he ſhould do. <hi>Was only the Man's Opinion about him, when Dying. And that it was Cuſtomary with</hi> Fox <hi>to write down ſuch Stories as</hi> Propheſies from the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.

Having cautioned you againſt this Book,</hi> I <hi>proceed concerning</hi> VVilliam Pen, <hi>that he was a falſe Prophet hath been proved, and more proof we have of his not being Inſpired and Infallible; that he</hi> ſhufled in the laſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution <hi>is well known. A</hi> Quaker <hi>(who valued him,) told me, that when a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101963:100"/>Conſtable came to him in the Meeting to lay hold on him, and ſaid,</hi> I doubt, Sir, you have been the Speaker <hi>(which was true,) Mr.</hi> Pen <hi>pointed to one afar of, (who had alſo ſpoken,)</hi> That is he. <hi>Whilſt the Constable went to him, Mr.</hi> Pen <hi>ran away out at a</hi> Back Door, <hi>This</hi> Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>ſaid,</hi> He could hardly believe his own Ears or Eyes; <hi>and could not Sleep quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeveral Nights after, that ſuch a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Speaker as Friend</hi> William <hi>was, would ſo ſpeak and do. Contrary Doctrins have been delivered from one and the ſame Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirit. In one Book againſt the</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt, <hi>he ſays,</hi> Tell the Church, <hi>&amp;c. The Church was not to be Judge of</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Conſcience. <hi>In another Book for his own Courts, againſt the Separate</hi> Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>he ſays,</hi> It was. <hi>For the late Liberty granted them by Authority, it is now declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Scripture is an exact Rule of Faith, and Obedience. And now the external Form of an Oath with us, is abated them; they ſwallow down ſuch Words</hi> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, <hi>&amp;c. which have from the Spirit been denyed to be lawful, eſpecially about</hi> Meum <hi>and</hi> Tuum <hi>I cannot believe the ſtory Mr.</hi> Pen <hi>tells of his Father, that he ſhould ſay to him on his Death Bed,</hi> Son, if you continue in your plain, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple way of Living, you will put an end to all Preachers to the end of the World. <hi>Is it likely ſo brave and worthy a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as his Father was, ſhould thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf, for my part, I cannot believe on Mr.</hi> Pen<hi>'s Teſtimony, however, if it be

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101963:105"/>Tricks have been ſometimes among the Perfect Ones. I doubt not but that this is ſent far and nigh as a Confirmation of their Faith.

               <p>And becauſe many of the <hi>Quakers</hi> are <hi>Socinians</hi> to my Knowledge, and the <hi>Socinians</hi> their Friends, I will ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on that Argument. Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> once brought in Socinianiſm among them. If Chriſt was only a Creature, tell me how can the Scripture tell us of the Love of God, in giving Chriſt more than any other thing? Or, which is more difficult for you to underſtand, the Love of Chriſt, in giving himſelf? The Love of God, in giving Chriſt? <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son. He that ſpared not his own Son, ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> Where he argues from the grearer to the leſſer. He that will give me a Thouſand Pound, will give me Five if occaſion be. But if God made a holy Man to preach a holy Law, and lead a holy Example in this more than Pardon, Grace, and Eternal Life? But your greater Difficuly is, how can the Apoſtle tell us of Length, Depth, Breadth and Heighth of the Love of Chriſt that paſſeth Knowledge (where elſe is the Love of God ſo expreſt? Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy knows but three Dimenſions, Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity, but the Love of Chriſt four. Now on their Notions we may talk of Chriſt's Love to himſelf, but not to us, for which of them would not ſuffer a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more than they imagine Chriſt did to acquire but the thouſandth part of the Glory they ſay he thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired?

                  <hi>Franciſcus Druid</hi> (that blaſphemer) and his Followers condemned all Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and call their Brethren Idolaters, and I think their Charge is true on their common Principle. To ſay <hi>Chriſt is indeed a Dependant and Subordinate God,</hi> and therefore a Relative and Subordinate Worſhip is due to him, That the <hi>Father is the Supream Cauſe, firſt Efficient and laſt End, but Chriſt is the middle or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſe of Salvation, and intermediate End of Religion,</hi> What ſignifies all this when it is no civil Worſhip given to him as the People did to <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. but they call it themſelves Divine, not ſo much as God, is the Popiſh Shifts for worſhipping of Saints, not ſo much as Chriſt. No wonder there is ſo great a diſtance between <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (pardon the Expreſſion, I know what I ſay, and after no mean Men) when ſuch charging one another is among them. <hi>Eſay</hi> ſays, Who ſhall declare his Generation, 53. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.

So it is a great Queſtion, whether the Holy Ghoſt be the power of God, or as <hi>Beedle</hi> and others ſay, a Created Angel? If it be the Vertue of God, it is Idolatry to give a Created Angel this Honour. If a created Angel, he is rob'd by others of his honour due to him, being not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, as it would be to Chriſt if he were thus overlookt.</p>

               <p>The great Objection is 17 <hi>John</hi> 3 <hi>This is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou hast ſent.</hi> Compare this and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 6.

They that ſay, the Scripture ſays plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is but <hi>one God, the Father of all,</hi> forget the next word, <hi>and ne Lord.</hi>
               </p>
